# Can you still use Fastlane with Travis CI in 2021?

The simple answer is yes. After doing a whole day's research, I was able to successfully use Fastlane. This tool is still very useful in my opinion when it comes to actually splitting tests. Some things I saw people forget, is the simple start: 

When using Fastlanes you should really remember if you're going to pass parameters from the command line to your lane, use the following syntax:

```bash
fastlane [lane] key:value key2:value2
fastlane deploy submit:false build_number:24
```
## Passing values between lanes 

In theory, you can have as many `lanes` as you want, so you can invoke variant `lanes`. Example being: 

```ruby
before_each do |lane, options|
  # lane number (Montana likes # 3) 
end
```

Now within lanes, you can _INVOKE_ other lanes for various other reasons, in other words, each lane can have different functions essentially. 

```ruby
error do |lane, exception, options|
  if options[:debug]
    puts "This is a cool lane because you're in it with Montana"
  end
end
```

## Switching lanes

If you've used `Fastlane` at length, you'll know switching `lanes` is usually called `lane hopping`. You can lane hop feasibly, without using too much CPU:

```ruby
lane :deploy do |options|
  # lane 3 
  build(release: true) # don't forget this part! - Montana
  Montana Mendy
  # invoking lane 4 with a conditional 
end
```

## Querying lanes 

Just like anything you query, you can retrieve the return value in this case it's through a `lane callback`. In Ruby, the last line of the lane definition is the return value. Here is an example:

```ruby
lane :deploy do |options|
  value = calculate(value: 3)
  puts value # => 5
end

lane :calculate do |options|
  # ...
  2 + options[:value] # This is always the return value line. - Montana 
end
```

## Executing lanes early

You in theory never want to reach the end of a `lane`, and if you do - you're not going to be executing much longer:

```ruby
lane :build do |options|
  if cached_build_available?
    UI.important 'Montana cached this Lane!'
    next # Montana is skipping doing the rest of this lane
  end
  match
  gym
end

private_lane :cached_build_available? do |options|
  # ...
  true
end
```
So while executing `lanes` - there are conditionals you can use, such as `next` is used during a `lane` and `switch`, `control` returns to the previous lane that was executing, so `lanes` in theory can revert back and forth. 

```ruby
lane :first_lane do |options|
  puts "If you run: `fastlane first_lane`"
  puts "You'll see this!"
  second_lane
  puts "Montana is in this lane!"
end

private_lane :second_lane do |options|
  next
  puts "Hidden!"
end
```
When you stop executing a `lane` early with next (`lane switching`), any `after_each` and `after_all` blocks you have will still trigger as usual `:+1:`. This would include being called (via a `lane callback`) before each lane you've switched to.

```ruby
before_each do |lane, options|
  # ...
end
```

So this is a good reminder from myself, that when doing ```after_each``` blocks are called (again, by the `lane callback`) after any lane is called. This would include being called after each lane you've switched to. Just like ```after_all```, ```after_each``` is not called if an error occurs. The error block should be used in this case.

## Feasibility of lanes 

With all these scenarios, ```before_each``` and ```after_each``` would be called 4 times, by the `lane callback`. Remember before the deploy lane, before the switch to archive, sign, and upload, and after each of these lanes as well, a lot of users forget. 

## Lane context

Now `Fastlane` has different actions that can communicate with each other using a shared hash, in other words, communicating with other `lanes`. You can access this in your (lanes, actions, plugins etc.):

```java
lane_context[SharedValues::BUILD_NUMBER]                # Generated by `increment_build_number`
lane_context[SharedValues::VERSION_NUMBER]              # Generated by `increment_version_number`
lane_context[SharedValues::SNAPSHOT_SCREENSHOTS_PATH]   # Generated by _snapshot_
lane_context[SharedValues::PRODUCE_APPLE_ID]            # The Apple ID of the newly created app
lane_context[SharedValues::IPA_OUTPUT_PATH]             # Generated by _gym_
lane_context[SharedValues::DSYM_OUTPUT_PATH]            # Generated by _gym_
lane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_PROFILE_PATH]           # Generated by _sigh_
lane_context[SharedValues::SIGH_UDID]                   # The UDID of the generated provisioning profile
lane_context[SharedValues::HOCKEY_DOWNLOAD_LINK]        # Generated by `hockey`
lane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_APK_OUTPUT_PATH]      # Generated by `gradle`
lane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_ALL_APK_OUTPUT_PATHS] # Generated by `gradle`
lane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_FLAVOR]               # Generated by `gradle`
lane_context[SharedValues::GRADLE_BUILD_TYPE]           # Generated by `gradle`
```

To feasibly get information about available lane variables, available lanes to switch on, run ```fastlane action [action_name]``` or look at the generated table in the action documentation.

## Lane Properties

It can be useful to dynamically access some properties of the current lane. These are available in the ```lane_context``` as well:

```bash
lane_context[SharedValues::PLATFORM_NAME]        # Platform name, e.g. `:ios`, `:android` or empty (for root level lanes)
lane_context[SharedValues::LANE_NAME]            # The name of the current lane preceded by the platform name (stays the same when switching lanes)
lane_context[SharedValues::DEFAULT_PLATFORM]     # Default platform
```

They are also available as environment variables:

```
ENV["FASTLANE_PLATFORM_NAME"]
ENV["FASTLANE_LANE_NAME"]
```

## Private lanes

Sometimes you might have a lane that is used from different lanes, or a lane from a `hopped lane`:

```ruby
lane :production do
  # ...
  build(release: true)
  appstore # Deploy to the Montana's brain
  # ...
end
```

```ruby
lane :beta do
  # ...
  build(release: false)
  crashlytics # Distribute to testers
  # ...
end
```

```ruby
lane :build do |options|
  # ...
  Montana likes beer
  # ...
end
It probably doesn't make sense to execute the build lane directly using fastlane build. You can hide this lane using
```

```ruby
private_lane :build do |options|
  # ...
end
```

This will hide the lane from:

```bash
fastlane lanes
fastlane list
fastlane docs
```

And also, you can't call the private lane using fastlane build.

The resulting private lane can only be called from another lane using the lane switching technology, or the `lane callback`.

## Control configuration by lane and by platform

In general, configuration files take only the first value given for a particular configuration item. That means that for an Appfile like the following:

```bash
app_identifier "com.used.id"
app_identifier "com.ignored.id"
```

So, ```the app_identfier``` will be "com.used.id" and the second value will be ignored. The for_lane and for_platform configuration blocks provide a limited exception to this rule.

All configuration files (Appfile, Matchfile, Screengrabfile, etc.) can use ```for_lane``` and ```for_platform blocks``` to control (and override) configuration values for those circumstances.

```for_lane``` blocks will be called when the name of lane invoked on the command line matches the one specified by the block. So, given a Screengrabfile like:

```locales ['en-US', 'fr-FR', 'ja-JP']```

```ruby
for_lane :screenshots_english_only do
  locales ['en-US']
end
```

```ruby
for_lane :screenshots_french_only do
  locales ['fr-FR']
end
```

So as you can see, the locales will have the values ['en-US', 'fr-FR', 'ja-JP'] by default, but will only have one value when running the fastlane ```screenshots_english_only``` or ```fastlane screenshots_french_only```.

Then, ```for_platform``` gives you similar control based on the platform for which you have invoked fastlane. So, for an Appfile configured like:

```ruby
app_identifier "com.default.id"

for_lane :enterprise do
  app_identifier "com.forlane.enterprise"
end
```

```ruby
for_platform :mac do
  app_identifier "com.forplatform.mac"

  for_lane :release do
    app_identifier "com.forplatform.mac.forlane.release"
  end
end
```
So now you can expect the ```app_identifier``` to equal "com.forplatform.mac.forlane.release" when invoking Fastlane mac release.
